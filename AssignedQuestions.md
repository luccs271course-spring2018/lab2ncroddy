**1.** A. The linear funding search is not very complex. It will always be done in the same way. It's constant factor, however, will vary.

B. Both linear searches are always linear. The amount of tasks that they are executing is some constant multiplied by N.

C. Lastly, the number of tasks to complete in the binary search will be log base 2 of N.

**2.** The binary search will not work. It's not moving parts of the array to make the search functional.

**3.** These ensure that the search process will not be stopped by objects within the code.

**4.** This keeps you from screwing up your code. You are not allowed to modify your arguments while this is active.

**5.** An alternative would be to change the value of your variable be set to null or -1 to show that it has no value. This sometimes confuses the program because -1 would sometimes be used for a positive number.
